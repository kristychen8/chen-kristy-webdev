## About Me

My name is Kristy Chen and I am a second year undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I will be working with America's Test Kitchen in July 2017 as a Digital Developer. I also enjoy hackathons and CS conferences, since I get to develop projects with brilliant developers.
You can find more about me and my projects [here](http://kristychen8.github.io).
